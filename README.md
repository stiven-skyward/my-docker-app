# Dockerized Python Flask Application (From Basics to Advanced)

## Overview
This repository covers the process of containerizing a Python Flask application with Docker, progressing from basic to more advanced topics. By following the steps outlined in each part, you'll learn how to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications efficiently. This guide is designed for users of all skill levels.

### Topics Covered
1. **Basic Level**
    - Introduction to Docker.
    - Creating and running a basic Docker container with a Flask application.
    - Building Docker images.
    - Running and stopping containers.

2. **Intermediate Level**
    - Working with environment variables in Docker.
    - Managing data persistence using Docker volumes.
    - Orchestrating multiple containers using `docker-compose` (e.g., Flask + MySQL).

3. **Advanced Level**
    - Optimizing Docker images using multi-stage builds.
    - Setting up complex Docker networks.
    - Deploying Docker containers to production environments (Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
    - Implementing container monitoring and logging.

## What You'll Learn
- **Basic**: By completing the basic section, you'll understand how to containerize and run a simple Flask application with Docker. This serves as a foundation for more complex workflows.
- **Intermediate**: You will learn how to manage more complex configurations, such as adding databases, handling environment variables, and persisting data across container restarts.
- **Advanced**: In the advanced section, you'll explore how to optimize Docker for production, deploy containers at scale, and monitor their performance. You'll also dive into networking and security best practices for containers.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.
- Docker installed on your local machine.

## How to Get Started
1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stiven-skyward/my-docker-app.git
    cd my-docker-app
    ```

2. **Choose your starting point**: Begin with the `basic` folder for an introduction, `intermediate` for more advanced usage, or `advanced` for deployment and optimization techniques.

3. **Documentation**: Each section contains detailed steps and screenshots to guide you through the process. Follow along and experiment with each command to build your understanding of Docker.
